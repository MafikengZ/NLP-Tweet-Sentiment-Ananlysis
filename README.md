# NLP-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
Build a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.
Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.

## Context

Many companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. These companies would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This insight would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.
## Problem

Climate change is on the rise and there is a growing group of people who are skeptical of whether or not climate change is real or a hoax.
## Problem Statement

Build a sentiment analsyis model to predict whether a person is for, against, or nuetral towards climate change based off of a tweet.
Data Available

The dataset aggregates tweets pertaining to climate change collected between Apr 27, 2015 and Feb 21, 2018. In total, 43943 tweets were collected. Each tweet is labelled as one of the following classes:
 
| Class| Description |
| :---        |          ---: |
| 2| News - The tweet links to factual news about climate change	|
| 1|	Pro - the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change |
| 0| Neutral - the tweet neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change	|
| -1| Anti - the tweet does not believe in man made climate change	|

## Purpose

Create a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.

Provide an accurate and robust solution to this task in order to give companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.
